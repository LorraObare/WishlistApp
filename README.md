<h1>Welcome to my Wish List AppðŸŒ¼</h1>

<h2>Background Story</h2>
<p>I was one day going through my wishes/ wish list of things I would want and I wanted to write that down on my phone because it would be easier to carry that around with me. So as usual I went online to try and find an app that could do this for me.</p>

<p>Honestly, I couldn't really find something so simple that I wanted for my wishlist. Nothing complicated, just an app that has lists of things I want for myself. So I said, why can I not just create something for myself and use?</p>

<p>Therefore, this is my wishlist app, just a simple page to write down my fairytale.âœ¨</p>
